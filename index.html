When I got out, I was in that
i was already through that
i had that
i had the studio
i went to the studio
i went to Fox studios
i had it all, and I looked at it and said,

<i>"This is a bigger jail than I just got out of."</i>

i don't want to take my time going to work
i got a motorcycle n' a sleeping bag
n' ten or fifteen girls what the hell I wanna
go off into and [sic] go to work for?

work for what, money?
i got all the money in the world!
i'm the king, man!
i run the underworld, guy!
i decide whose does [sic] what n' where they do it at!

what am I gonna...
run around and act like I'm some teenybopper
somewhere for somebody else's money?

i make the money, man...

<b>i roll the nickels.</b>

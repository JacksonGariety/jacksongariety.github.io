A Klee painting named 'Angelus Novus' shows
an angel looking as though he is about to move
away from something he is fixedly contemplating.
His eyes are staring, his mouth is open,
his wings are spread.

This is how one pictures the angel of history.
His face is turned toward the past.
Where we perceive a chain of events,
he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage
upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet.

The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead,
and make whole what has been smashed.
But a storm is blowing from Paradise;
it has got caught in his wings with such violence
that the angel can no longer close them.

This storm irresistibly propels him into the future
to which his back is turned,
while the pile of debris before him grows skyward.

<b>This storm is what we call progress.</b>

-- W. Benjamin
